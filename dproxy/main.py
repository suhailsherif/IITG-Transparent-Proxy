# Arguments should be as follows
# 		argv[1] : target_link
#		argv[2] : output_link
#		argv[3] (optional) : '-p' (to enable usage behind proxy)
#		argv[4] (optional) : proxy (if not provided, but '-p' given, then environment variable is used.
#
#
# Note that if '-p' parameter is passed, then http_proxy would be used
# (either from the next parameter or from environment variable)
