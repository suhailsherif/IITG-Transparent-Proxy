#### TODO :
- Removing cache entries
- Improvements (Includes analysis of the working of the IITG DNS)

#### HowTo :
- Run install script `./install.sh`
- GUI  `./Allproxy`. Enable/Disable proxies as desired.
- From terminal open `config/config.sh`; specify proxy for **nproxy**, and others as required.


#### Tips :
- You can use **kde-nm-connection-editor** in package **plasma-nm** to create wireless access-point on your Ubuntu machine.
- Always prefer local proxy to global proxy.

#### *Tested OS :*
- Ubuntu 14.04
- Linux Mint


#### *Beware !*
Non-authentic DNS servers can be used VERY 	convincingly for phishing. 
Make sure you are in control of your configuration.
